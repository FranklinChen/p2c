NAME
     p2cc - Pascal compiler using p2c

SYNOPSIS
     p2cc [ options and files ]

DESCRIPTION
     _P_2_c_c is a Pascal compiler that works  by  running  _p_2_c,  the
     Pascal to C translator, followed by _c_c, the C compiler.

     All command-line options and arguments are  passed  directly
     to  the C compiler, except that files ending with .p or .pas
     are passed through _p_2_c first, and that  the  options  listed
     below  are interpreted specially by _p_2_c_c. As usual, programs
     made up of several source modules can be compiled all on one
     _p_2_c_c  command,  or  separately using _p_2_c_c -c and then linked
     afterwards with a final _p_2_c_c command.

OPTIONS
     -p2c Translate .p and .pas files to C but do not compile the
          resulting .c files.  This is analogous to the -S and -c
          options of most C compilers, which stop  with  assembly
          language or unlinked object files, respectively.

     -p2c_o_p_t_i_o_n
          Pass _o_p_t_i_o_n to _p_2_c rather than to the C compiler.

     -O   This switch is passed on to the C  compiler  to  enable
          optional   optimization   of   the  program.   It  also
          instructs _p_2_c to do a few  optimizations  of  its  own,
          e.g., disabling certain run-time range checks.

     -I_d_i_r
          The -I switch is passed to both _p_2_c and the C compiler,
          where it will identify places to look for Pascal inter-
          face texts or C .h files, respectively.

     -v   Enable "verbose" mode.  This affects both _p_2_c and the C
          compiler.

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variables may be  used  to  affect
     the operation of _p_2_c_c.

     P2CC_PAT
          This variable holds a regular expression for  recogniz-
          ing  the  names of Pascal files.  By default, it recog-
          nizes strings which end in .p or .pas.

     P2CC_CC
          This holds the name of the command to run  the  C  com-
          piler.  Default is cc.

     P2CC_CCOPTS
          This holds additional arguments to be passed to the  cc
          command, before the names of any source files.

     P2CC_CCOPTS2
          These arguments are passed to the cc command _a_f_t_e_r  the
          names of source files.

     P2CC_LIBP2C
          This is the name of the libp2c.a file holding _p_2_c  run-
          time  routines.  Its default is -lp2c, which causes the
          linker to look for libp2c.a in  the  usual  places  for
          libraries.

     P2CC_P2C
          This holds the name of the command to run  _p_2_c.  It  is
          p2c by default.

     P2CC_P2COPTS
          These are arguments to be passed to _p_2_c on the  command
          line.   The  default  specifies  -comp,  which  set the
          defaults for various _p_2_c configuration  options  to  be
          more  suitable for compilation rather than translation,
          and -local, which sets other options  to  work  on  the
          assumption  that  the  output from _p_2_c will be compiled
          and run on the  same  type  of  machine  that  ran  _p_2_c
          itself.

     P2CC_SUFFIX
          This is the suffix to use for the names of temporary  C
          source  files.   The  default is ..c, ensuring that _p_2_c
          will not inadvertently  erase  .c  files  in  the  same
          directory as the Pascal source files.  Note that if the
          -p2c option is used, the suffix is forced instead to .c
          since the user has explicitly asked for C source files.
